> A small date time manipulation library

Here is a link to the [documentation](./docs).

## Why

Why do we need another date manipulation library? The answer is we don't, however my limited use of [Moment](https://momentjs.com/), [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/), and [DateJS](http://www.datejs.com/) seems to constantly remind me that dependencies suck. Not that those libraries are bad, in fact they are extremely good at what they do. However along with those few functions that I actually use, come a slew of extra added functionality that I never do. Enter Chronos.
